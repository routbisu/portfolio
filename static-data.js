And hiring more waiters means adding to the operational costs of the restaurant. A lot of times customers have to wait for the waiter to come to take their order, and if they want to make changes to the order, they have to call the waiter again and Wait for him to come. When they are done with their meal and want to request the cheque, they have to call for the waiter again.`,

What this means for restaurants is improved table utilization, better customer experience and they also save money because they donâ€™t need to hire as many waiters as before. So, I will show you how this is done in this short demo.`
